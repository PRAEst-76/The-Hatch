# The Hatch
 A usable hatch for Daggerfall Unity buildings

Hacked model only at the moment as I'm not sure how to make the hatch usable (ie acts like a ladder to move player between ladder top/bottom markers). I don't know C# so a working version is on hold until I can up my skills or get someone else to do it.
